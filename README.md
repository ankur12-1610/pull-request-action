## 📝 Prerequisites:

You'll need to create a "Repository Secret" of name `GIPHY_TOKEN` and its value should be the API key of [giphy](https://giphy.com/). Here is the [article](https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020283431-Request-A-GIPHY-API-Key) on how to set up the giphy API KEY.

## :arrow_up: Usage:

Create a `.github/workflows/pr-activity.yml` file in the repository of your choice, then add following code to it:

```yaml
name: 'Pull Request Action 🚀'

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: ankur12-1610/pull-request-action@main
        with:
          GIPHY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GIPHY_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          COMMENT_TEXT: 'thanks for submitting a pull request! We will try to review it as soon as we can :)' #enter your custom comment in the content variable
          PR_REACTION: 'rocket' #enter your reaction here
          GIPHY_TOPIC: 'Thanks a lot' #enter your giphy topic here
          TAG_AUTHOR: true #enter true if you want to tag the author of the pull request
          ASSIGN_TO_AUTHOR: true #enter true if you want to assign the pull request to the author of the pull request
          FIRST_TIMERS_MESSAGE: ':tada: Thanks for your first contribution in this repo!' #your custom message for the first timers

```

The comment and the reaction to the PR can be customized according to the user.

### 💬 COMMENT_TEXT:

The `COMMENT_TEXT` variable can take any string so feel free to enter any comment in this section.
```yml
          COMMENT_TEXT: 'thanks for submitting a pull request! We will try to review it as soon as we can :)' #enter your custom comment in the content variable

```

### 🚀 PR_REACTION:

The `PR_REACTION` variable can also be customized. The available reactions are:

| content    | emoji |
| ---------- | :---: |
| `+1`       |  👍   |
| `-1`       |  👎   |
| `laugh`    |  😄   |
| `confused` |  😕   |
| `rocket`   |  🚀   |
| `eyes`     |  👀   |
| `heart`    |  ❤️   |
| `hooray`   |  🎉   |
```yml
          PR_REACTION: 'rocket' #enter your reaction here
```


### 🏷️ TAG_AUTHOR:

The `TAG_AUTHOR` has either `true` or `false` boolean fields. Assigning `true` will tag the author of the PR in the comment.
```yml
          TAG_AUTHOR: true #enter true if you want to tag the author of the pull request or enter fase

```

### 🏁 ASSIGN_TO_AUTHOR:

The `ASSIGN_TO_AUTHOR` has either `true` or `false` boolean fields. Assigning `true` will assign the PR to the author of the PR.
```yml
          ASSIGN_TO_AUTHOR: true #enter true if you want to assign the pull request to the author or enter false

```

### If user wants to add GIF to the comment:

### 🪙 GIPHY_TOKEN:

Without `GIPHY_TOKEN` secret, the workflow cannot fetch gifs.
```yml
          GIPHY_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GIPHY_TOKEN }}

```

### 📍 GIPHY_TOPIC:

The `GIPHTY_TOPIC` variable can take any input, so whether you want a "thankyou" gif or "welcome" all of them is possible ;) so feel free to exploit it.
```yml
          GIPHY_TOPIC: 'Thanks a lot' #enter your topic here

```

### 😄 FIRST_TIMERS_MESSAGE:

In order to give a message to the first timers, this variable can take any input.
```yml
          FIRST_TIMERS_MESSAGE: ':tada: Thanks for your first contribution in this repo!' #your custom message for the first timers

```
